# 💥 Metasploit Payload Attack in Virtual Lab (Educational Use Only)

> ⚠️ This project is performed in a **secure, isolated virtual environment** using Kali Linux and Windows 11 Virtual Machines. It is intended strictly for **educational and awareness purposes** related to ethical hacking and penetration testing.

---

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to simulate a **reverse shell attack** by generating and deploying a malicious payload using **Metasploit Framework** on Kali Linux, and gaining remote access to a **Windows 11 victim machine**. This setup helps understand:
- How attackers exploit systems
- What actions they can take once inside
- How to **prevent** such attacks in real-world environments

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Kali Linux (Attacker VM)**
- **Windows 11 (Victim VM)**
- **Metasploit Framework**
- **Python HTTP Server**
- **VirtualBox / VMware**
